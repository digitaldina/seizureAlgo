an algorithm that will read videos and determine the likelyhood of the video causing a seizure through it's accuracy. 
<br>
we used 2 videos to train the model. 1 for triggers:<br>

This csv file is probably not much use to you, so if you want to see it in action, contact me to give you access to the AutoML link. Then, you would just add and image and the model will automatically classify that image as flashy or not flashy
